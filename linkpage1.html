<h1>Business Cases Implementation</h1>
    <h2>Business Case: Faculty Recruitment And Management</h2>
        <p>The Faculty Recruitment And Management aligns with the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>SDG 4: Quality Education</h2>
                <p>Ensures inclusive and equitable quality education and promotes lifelong learning opportunities for all through a streamlined and accessible admission process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities</h2>
                <p>Promotes fairness and transparency in the admission process, reducing biases and ensuring equal opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p>Implementation by using <strong>Hash Tables</strong>, <strong>Priority Queue</strong>, and <strong>Balanced Trees</strong> (AVL Trees).</p>
    
<div class="section">
        <h3>1.Balanced Trees (AVL Trees)</h3>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Operations such as insertion and traversal are efficient, with 
            O(logn) complexity due to the self-balancing nature of AVL Trees.</p>
        <p><strong>Example Implementation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Insertion.</li>
            <li>In-Order Traversal.</li>
            <li>Balancing the Tree.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>AVL Trees</strong> are the most intuitive and relevant for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong> Efficient Sorting:</strong> Balance Guarantee.</li>
            <li><strong>Searching for Specific Data:</strong> Real-Time Data Handling.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>2. Priority Queue</h3>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Process applications based on priority (e.g., merit, reservation, or first-come-first-serve).</p>
        <p><strong>Example Implementation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Priority:</strong> Merit scores or time of application.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Structure:</strong> Min-heap or Max-heap.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Guarantees the highest-priority application is processed first.</li>
            <li>Efficient insertion and extraction (<code>O(log n)</code>).</li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>3. Hash Table</h3>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Efficiently store and retrieve student records.</p>
        <p><strong>Example Implementation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key:</strong> Student ID or unique application number.</li>
            <li><strong>Value:</strong> Details like name, scores, preferences, and status.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fast lookups for student data (<code>O(1)</code> on average).</li>
            <li>Easily update records during the admission process.</li>
